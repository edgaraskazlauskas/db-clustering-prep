Test valueing relations by enum values, not numbers (weak, medium, strong)

IDEA - the extractor must extract relatively to the whole graph. If we take a subset of the db (one schema), it should extract it differently compared to if it was inside a larger graph (all schemas).

Since the results are decent by themselfves, try not to affect a weight unless totally necessary
